## Description

This game is a tile-based puzzle game built using p5.js. The player controls a green circle to navigate through randomized mazes, avoiding walls to reach the red goal and advance to the next stage.

---

## Setup and Interaction Instructions

Controls: Use W-A-S-D or the Arrow Keys to move the green circle.
Objective: Navigate to the Red Square to clear the level.
Progression: Once the goal is reached, the game automatically loops to the next level.

# Iteration Notes

- Smoother Collision: Reduced the green circle's internal hitbox size to prevent it from getting stuck on wall corners, allowing for "sliding" movement.
- Dual Controls: Added WASD support alongside Arrow keys to accommodate different player hand preferences.
- UI Optimization: centered the game canvas on the screen and added a top header bar to display the current Level number, so players know their progress.
